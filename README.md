## 🗂️ Database Design

This section outlines the core entities in the Airbnb Clone backend along with their key fields and relationships.

### 1. Users
Represents individuals who can list properties or make bookings.

**Key Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier for the user
- `username`: Unique username
- `email`: User's email address
- `password`: Hashed password
- `is_host`: Boolean indicating if the user is a host

**Relationships:**
- A user can list multiple properties (One-to-Many)
- A user can make multiple bookings (One-to-Many)
- A user can write multiple reviews (One-to-Many)

---

### 2. Properties
Represents properties listed by hosts for booking.

**Key Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier for the property
- `title`: Name or title of the listing
- `description`: Detailed description of the property
- `price_per_night`: Cost per night
- `host_id`: Foreign key linking to the user who listed it

**Relationships:**
- A property is listed by one host (Many-to-One)
- A property can have multiple bookings (One-to-Many)
- A property can have multiple reviews (One-to-Many)

---

### 3. Bookings
Represents a reservation made by a user on a property.

**Key Fields:**
- `id`: Unique booking ID
- `user_id`: Foreign key to the user who made the booking
- `property_id`: Foreign key to the booked property
- `start_date`: Check-in date
- `end_date`: Check-out date

**Relationships:**
- A booking is made by one user (Many-to-One)
- A booking belongs to one property (Many-to-One)
- A booking can have one payment (One-to-One)

---

### 4. Payments
Represents the financial transactions for bookings.

**Key Fields:**
- `id`: Unique payment ID
- `booking_id`: Foreign key to the associated booking
- `amount`: Total payment amount
- `status`: Payment status (e.g., completed, pending)
- `payment_method`: Method used (e.g., card, PayPal)

**Relationships:**
- Each payment is associated with one booking (One-to-One)

---

### 5. Reviews
Represents feedback provided by users for properties.

**Key Fields:**
- `id`: Unique review ID
- `user_id`: Foreign key to the user who wrote the review
- `property_id`: Foreign key to the reviewed property
- `rating`: Numerical rating (e.g., 1-5)
- `comment`: Text feedback

**Relationships:**
- A user can leave multiple reviews (One-to-Many)
- A property can have multiple reviews (One-to-Many)

## 🔒 API Security

Securing the backend APIs is a critical aspect of the Airbnb Clone project to ensure user trust, data integrity, and secure financial transactions.

### 🔑 Key Security Measures

1. **Authentication**
   - We implement secure authentication using token-based systems such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2.
   - Only registered and verified users can access protected endpoints.

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures users can only perform actions they are permitted to (e.g., only hosts can list properties, only property owners can update/delete listings).
   - Access to sensitive endpoints is restricted based on user roles and ownership.

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - To prevent abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, rate limiting is applied to all API endpoints using tools like Django Ratelimit or third-party middleware.

4. **Data Validation & Sanitization**
   - All inputs are validated and sanitized to protect against common attacks such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

5. **HTTPS Enforcement**
   - All communications are encrypted using HTTPS to protect data in transit.

6. **Secure Payments**
   - Integration with trusted third-party payment providers ensures secure handling of financial data.
   - Sensitive payment details are never stored directly in our system.

### 🛡️ Why Security is Crucial

- **Protecting User Data:** User credentials, personal information, and contact details must be securely handled to maintain privacy and prevent identity theft.
- **Securing Payments:** Unauthorized access or tampering with financial transactions can lead to fraud or monetary loss.
- **Maintaining Platform Trust:** A secure API builds user confidence and trust in the platform.
- **Preventing Abuse:** Rate limiting and role-based permissions help mitigate spam, brute-force attacks, and misuse of the platform.
## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. It is a development practice where code changes are automatically tested and deployed, enabling teams to deliver updates faster and more reliably.

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically runs tests and checks every time code is pushed to the repository, ensuring new changes do not break the existing codebase.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automatically deploys code to staging or production environments after passing all tests and checks.

### Why CI/CD is Important for This Project

- **Faster Development Cycles:** Automates the build, test, and deployment process.
- **Improved Code Quality:** Catch bugs early through automated testing.
- **Reduced Manual Errors:** Removes the need for manual deployment steps.
- **Consistent Environments:** Ensures applications run in the same way across different environments using Docker.
- **Instant Feedback:** Developers receive immediate feedback on their code.

### 🧰 Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions:** Automates CI/CD workflows directly from the GitHub repository (e.g., testing, linting, deployment).
- **Docker:** Ensures consistent build and runtime environments across machines and environments.
- **Docker Hub / GitHub Container Registry:** Stores and distributes Docker images for different environments.
- **Heroku / AWS / Render (optional):** Platforms to host and deploy the application automatically after each successful build.
